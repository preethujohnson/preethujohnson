A tech-savvy engineer with a strong inclination toward Math. Worked in different academic roles in Math and Quants. 
My interest in the subject led to research new domains where I can utilize my mathematical and computational skills. 
The research showed me the world of Data Science and I am currently pursuing a 
BS program at IIT Madras in Programming and Data Science to dive deep into the new learning environment.
 I have done certification courses in Power BI, Tableau, and SQL. 
My previous jobs have molded me with good skills in project management, execution, and time-to-time delivery. Being a self-learner, I am upskilling myself to fit into the new challenging roles and the complex needs of the industry.
